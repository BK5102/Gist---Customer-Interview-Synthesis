## 1. What is Gist

An AI tool that takes customer-interview transcripts (text or audio) and
returns themed synthesis with traceable quotes — every quote is
verified verbatim against the source transcript before it reaches the
output. Built for solo founders doing customer discovery.

**Live in production:**
- Frontend: https://gist-customer-interview-synthesis.vercel.app
- Backend API: https://gist-backend-production-ab73.up.railway.app
- GitHub: https://github.com/BK5102/Gist---Customer-Interview-Synthesis

**Latest pushed commit:** `2185efd` — design: remove all subsection borders site-wide

**Deploy gotcha — `gist/` wrapper:** Both Railway and Vercel default to
the repo root. They must be told the code lives at `gist/backend` /
`gist/frontend`. Symptoms when skipped:
- Railway: `directory /build-sessions/.../backend does not exist`
- Vercel: `No Output Directory named "public" found`

## 3. Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI, Python 3.11+ |
| Frontend | Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, react-markdown, @supabase/ssr |
| Synthesis | Anthropic SDK; `claude-sonnet-4-6` (clustering, insights), `claude-haiku-4-5` (extraction). All via tool-use for structured output |
| Audio | Groq `whisper-large-v3` (free tier, preferred) **or** OpenAI `whisper-1` (paid fallback). Files >24 MB chunked via ffmpeg `-c copy`. Static ffmpeg via `imageio-ffmpeg` |
| Auth | Supabase (HS256 legacy + ES256/RS256 via JWKS — alg detected per-token), email verification/reset-password UI |
| Database | Supabase Postgres with row-level security; backend uses service-role key |
| Notion | OAuth (Public integration) OR internal-token fallback; markdown→blocks with chunking (100-block / 2000-char) and 429 backoff |
| Hosting | Railway (backend), Vercel (frontend), Supabase (auth + DB) |

## 4. Environment variables

### `gist/backend/.env` (server-side secrets, NOT committed)

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...                       # or OPENAI_API_KEY for audio

NOTION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=...           # REQUIRED in prod — Fernet key for encrypting Notion tokens at rest
                                          # Generate: python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"

```

### `gist/frontend/.env.local` (Next.js public + private, NOT committed)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<ref>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
```

### Railway env vars (production backend)

Same as `backend/.env` PLUS:

```
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://gist-customer-interview-synthesis.vercel.app
```

Comma-separated, no spaces around commas, no trailing slashes. Don't
set `PORT` — Railway provides `$PORT` and the Procfile honors it.

### Vercel env vars (production frontend)

Same three as `frontend/.env.local` but with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://gist-backend-production-ab73.up.railway.app`.

## 5. Build phases — what's been done

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | Extract → cluster → insights → markdown pipeline, verbatim quote verification | ✅ |
| Phase 1 | Audio transcription (Groq + OpenAI), ffmpeg chunking, async job pattern, per-file labels, drag-drop UI | ✅ |
| Phase 2 | Supabase auth, JWT verification, Postgres persistence, projects/syntheses dashboards | ✅ |
| Phase 3 | Notion OAuth + internal token, markdown→blocks, push, OAuth CSRF nonce, block/rich_text chunking, 429 backoff | ✅ |
| Deploy | Railway backend + Vercel frontend + Supabase + Notion integration, all live | ✅ |
| Design reset | Replaced vibe-coded design (violet gradients, floating orbs, glass-blur, staggered animations) with editorial/precise direction: near-black buttons, deep teal accent, border-defined surfaces, left-aligned hero, direct copy | ✅ |
| UX improvements | Breadcrumbs on all inner pages, "keep tab open" synthesis messaging, "built for founders" landing copy, defensive JSON rendering | ✅ |
| Security hardening | IDOR fixes in db.py, per-user rate limiting on synthesis/Notion/project-create endpoints, RLS tightened to SELECT-only on all four tables, project name length validation | ✅ |
| UX rework | Project-first flow enforced (synthesis always requires a project), workspace hub redesigned (2-col, no standalone New synthesis), copy rewrite across page.tsx, tab-open messaging clarified | ✅ |
| Projects page v2 | Each project card now lists its synthesis runs (date-labeled, linked to `/syntheses/{id}`) and a one-liner pointing to Private saves. Backend: removed auto-create fallback that named projects after synthesis filenames — `project_id` is now required by `/synthesize` when DB is available. | ✅ |
| Security audit | Full OWASP audit + 10 fixes: exception internals no longer reach clients; NOTION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY documented; FastAPI docs disabled in prod; HSTS added; CORS tightened; auth callback `next` param validated; PBKDF2 raised to 600K iterations; Notion OAuth cancel redirects to UI; N+1 project fetches replaced with single request; job pruning on every poll. | ✅ |
| Design audit | `/ui-design-prompts` full audit. 6 fixes: removed border+shadow double on cards and navbar; unified `zinc-*` → `neutral-*` across all 11 frontend files; standardized inner page header spacing to `mb-8`; replaced blue-50/blue-700 "Extracting" badge with brand teal; added `translateY` to `fadeIn` keyframe; fixed `<p>` as flex container. | ✅ |
| Border removal | Removed all subsection borders across all pages: `.card` border stripped from globals.css (cascades site-wide); section dividers (`border-t`), info panels, file list items, and all colored alert borders (red/green/amber) removed inline per page. Dashed drag-and-drop zones, form input borders, and button borders preserved. | ✅ Current |
| Phase 4 | Real users, iterate on feedback | ⏳ Open |

## 6. Production setup — exact steps that work

### Supabase

1. Create project at https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Project Settings → Data API** → copy:
   - **Project URL** (strip `/rest/v1/` if present)
   - **anon public** key (legacy tab) → frontend
   - **service_role secret** key (legacy tab) → backend
3. **Project Settings → Auth → JWT Keys → Legacy JWT Secret** → backend
4. **Authentication → Email** → turn on email confirmation before inviting strangers.
5. **SQL Editor**: paste `gist/backend/schema.sql` → Run. Then run all migration files in `gist/backend/migrations/` in chronological order. Then:
   ```sql
   NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
   ```

### Migrations applied in production (run in order)

```
2026-05-21_events.sql
2026-05-21_scrub_plaintext_syntheses.sql
2026-05-21_scrub_transcript_content.sql
2026-05-21_encrypted_artifacts.sql
2026-05-22_encrypted_artifacts_project_ownership.sql
2026-05-24_tighten_rls.sql                          ← syntheses + transcripts → SELECT-only
2026-05-24_tighten_rls_projects_connections.sql      ← projects + notion_connections → SELECT-only
```

### Notion (internal token — recommended for solo use)

1. https://notion.so/profile/integrations → **+ New integration**
2. Type: Internal. Capabilities: Read + Update + Insert content.
3. Copy **Installation access token** → `NOTION_INTERNAL_TOKEN`
4. In Notion, open the target database → **⋯ → Connections → + Add connections → Gist → Confirm**

### Railway (backend)

1. **+ New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo**
2. Service **Settings → Build → Root Directory** = `gist/backend`
3. **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain**
4. **Variables**: paste each line from local `backend/.env`. Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to the Vercel URL.
5. Verify `/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`

### Vercel (frontend)

1. **+ Add New → Project** → import same repo
2. **Framework Preset = Next.js**
3. **Root Directory = `gist/frontend`**
4. Env vars: the three `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` pointing at Railway.
5. Deploy. Add the Vercel URL to Railway's `CORS_ORIGINS`.

---

## 7. Common production gotchas

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` on Supabase URL | Free-tier project paused | Supabase dashboard → **Restart project** |
| "CORS error" | Vercel URL not in Railway's `CORS_ORIGINS`, OR backend threw an unhandled 500 (errors bypass CORS middleware) | Check Railway env first; check Railway logs for the real error |
| `Could not find the table 'public.X' in the schema cache` | PostgREST cache stale after running schema | `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` in SQL Editor |
| `Invalid path specified in request URL` | URL has `/rest/v1/` suffix | Strip suffix from env |
| Pages render blank on load | Fetch threw and `setLoading(false)` never ran | All loads are wrapped in try/finally |
| `httpx.RemoteProtocolError ConnectionTerminated` | Supabase HTTP/2 stale connection | `@_with_db_retry` in `db.py` handles this with one retry |
| Notion push fails for long syntheses | >100 blocks or >2000 chars per text | Already fixed: chunks blocks via PATCH, splits text at word boundaries |
| JWT verification fails with "alg not allowed" | Supabase migrated to ES256 JWT signing | Already fixed: `verify_token` detects alg from header |

---

## 8. Local dev quickstart

```bash
# Backend
cd gist/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env           # fill in keys
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd gist/frontend
npm install
# Create .env.local with the 3 NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 9. Architecture decisions worth remembering

1. **All LLM prompts live in `synth/prompts.py`** — no inline strings elsewhere
2. **Quote verification is a hard post-check, not a prompt hint** — `verify.py` normalizes both strings and does substring containment. Themes whose quotes can't be found are dropped.
3. **Tool-use over JSON mode** for structured LLM output — more reliable
4. **Cache by SHA1 of input, not mtime**
5. **`load_dotenv(override=True)`** — defeats empty shell vars silently overriding `.env`
6. **Service-role key on backend, RLS on tables** — backend bypasses RLS and enforces ownership in Python
7. **Conditional DB persistence** — pipeline runs even if DB write fails; user still gets markdown
8. **Async job pattern for `/synthesize`** — POST returns 202 + `job_id` in ~6ms; frontend polls `/jobs/{id}` every 2s
9. **In-memory job store (`JOBS` dict)** — works for v1; Phase 2 was supposed to swap to Postgres-backed jobs, still pending
10. **`@_with_db_retry` decorator** — single retry on `RemoteProtocolError` / `ConnectError` / `ReadError`
11. **OAuth state nonce** — random 32-byte token in `oauth_states` table, 10-min TTL, single-use
12. **Job polling is authenticated and owner-checked** — `GET /jobs/{job_id}` requires auth and checks `job["user_id"]` against the requesting user; returns 404 on mismatch
13. **Security headers in both backend and frontend** — `nosniff`, `DENY` framing, strict referrer policy, permissions policy
14. **PROMPT.md is durable rebuild memory** — committed to repo so it survives across machines and sessions
15. **Password-based private saves** — encryption/decryption happen in the browser (AES-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA256). Password never stored or sent. Forgetting the save password makes the encrypted artifact unrecoverable.
16. **Signed-in brand navigation** — clicking the `G`/Gist logo sends signed-in users to `/?landing=1`, rendering the landing page with the signed-in navbar.
17. **Design direction: editorial/precise, not decorative** — near-black primary buttons (`bg-neutral-900`), deep teal accent (`brand-700 = #0f766e`), borderless surfaces (no shadows, no blur, no gradients, no card borders — background color alone separates sections), left-aligned hero, direct copy. Design communicates restraint and trust — appropriate for a tool that handles sensitive customer research data.
18. **IDOR defense in db.py** — `get_syntheses_for_project(user_id, project_id)` and `get_transcripts_for_project(user_id, project_id)` both require `user_id` and enforce ownership via a `projects!inner(user_id)` join. Safe to call from any context.
19. **Per-user rate limiting via in-memory sliding window** — `defaultdict(deque)` per endpoint category. Synthesis: 5/10min, max 2 concurrent. Notion proxy: 20/60s. Project creation: 10/10min. All configurable via env vars.
20. **RLS is SELECT-only on backend-owned tables** — `syntheses`, `transcripts`, `projects`, and `notion_connections` use `FOR SELECT` policies. The backend service-role key handles all writes; client JWTs can only read their own rows. `encrypted_artifacts` retains `FOR ALL` with `WITH CHECK` because the browser writes directly to Supabase.
21. **Project-first synthesis flow** — synthesis always requires a `?project=<id>` context. Visiting `/?upload=1` without a project falls through to the workspace hub. The standalone "New synthesis" entry point has been removed. Flow: Projects → pick or create project → New synthesis (per-project row action).
22. **Projects page synthesis list** — each project card loads syntheses via `GET /projects?include_syntheses=true` (single request) and displays them as clickable date-labeled rows linking to `/syntheses/{id}`. A one-liner at the bottom of each card directs users to Private saves for encrypted reports.
23. **Project auto-naming removed** — `/synthesize` now returns 400 if `project_id` is missing when the DB is available, instead of auto-creating a project named `"Synthesis {filename}"`. This was the root cause of some projects showing synthesis filenames as their names.
24. **PBKDF2 iterations at 600K** — NIST SP 800-132 (2023) minimum for SHA-256. Old saves decrypt correctly because each record stores its own `iterations` value; new saves get 600K. The password that protects research data is never stored anywhere.
25. **N+1 projects/syntheses fetch eliminated** — `GET /projects?include_syntheses=true` returns all projects with their syntheses in one round trip. The backend loops the same `get_syntheses_for_project` calls; no new query.
26. **Job pruning on every `GET /jobs/{id}` poll** — `_prune_jobs()` runs on each poll, not only when a new synthesis is submitted. Prevents stale jobs accumulating in memory between synthesis sessions.
27. **CORS locked to explicit headers** — `allow_headers` is `["Authorization", "Content-Type"]` (not `"*"`); `allow_methods` includes `DELETE` for the Notion disconnect route.
28. **FastAPI docs disabled in production** — `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json` are `None` when `APP_ENV=production` or `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production`. Available in dev.
29. **Auth error internals hidden from clients** — pipeline crash exceptions are logged server-side (`logging.getLogger("gist").exception(...)`) and return a generic `"An unexpected error occurred"` message to the polling client. Auth module exceptions return `"Authentication failed"` without the httpx/jwt error string.
30. **Auth callback `next` param restricted to relative paths** — `next` must match `/[^/].*` or be `/` exactly; `//evil.com` or absolute URLs are silently replaced with `/`.
31. **Design system rules enforced by audit** — cards use border only (no `shadow-soft`); navbar uses border-bottom only (no `shadow-sm`); single neutral scale (`neutral-*`) throughout — `zinc-*` removed; palette max: neutral + brand-teal + red/green/amber semantic; no blue accent; `fadeIn` includes `translateY(4px→0)` for proper entrance feel.

## 9A. Security and trust posture

Critical user insight: the target audience (founders, PMs, researchers)
will not upload company/customer data to a random new tool without trust.
Security is part of the product, not just infrastructure.

**Current posture:**

- Supabase Auth gates all protected routes.
- All four core tables have RLS enabled; SELECT-only policies for tables the backend owns; `encrypted_artifacts` allows client-side INSERT with ownership check.
- Backend uses service-role key (bypasses RLS) and enforces ownership in Python before calling db helpers.
- `get_syntheses_for_project` and `get_transcripts_for_project` enforce user ownership via join — safe regardless of call site.
- Per-user rate limits: synthesis (5/10min, max 2 concurrent), Notion proxy (20/60s), project creation (10/10min).
- Raw transcripts not persisted by default (`STORE_TRANSCRIPTS=false`).
- Synthesis cache disabled by default (`ENABLE_SYNTH_CACHE=false`).
- Plaintext synthesis persistence disabled by default (`STORE_PLAINTEXT_SYNTHESES=false`).
- Browser-side AES-GCM-256 encrypted private saves; PBKDF2-SHA256 at 600K iterations; password never leaves the device.
- Notion OAuth uses single-use CSRF nonces (`oauth_states` table).
- Notion access tokens encrypted at rest with Fernet when `NOTION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set. Key is documented in `.env.example`.
- CORS restricted to configured origins; explicit `allow_headers` list.
- HSTS (`max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains`) added in production.
- FastAPI docs disabled in production (`/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json` return 404).
- Exception internals never reach clients — logged server-side only.
- Auth callback `next` param validated to relative paths only.
- Frontend CSP set in `next.config.mjs` (includes `'unsafe-inline'` — nonce-based tightening is a future item).

**Trust gaps remaining:**

- No public `/security` or `/privacy` page.
- No deletion/retention controls for projects, syntheses, or encrypted artifacts.
- No event logging wired (analytics `events` table exists but no writes yet).
- Audio/video sent to Groq or OpenAI for transcription (third-party data processor).
- Transcript text and themes sent to Anthropic (third-party data processor).
- In-memory job store resets on backend restart (jobs lost).
- `NOTION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` not yet set in Railway production — Notion tokens stored plaintext until set. Reconnect required after setting the key.
- `requirements.txt` dependency versions unpinned — no CVE scanning in CI.
- No test suite or CI/CD pipeline.

**Raw transcript privacy rule (production must enforce):**

```
STORE_TRANSCRIPTS=false
ENABLE_SYNTH_CACHE=false
STORE_PLAINTEXT_SYNTHESES=false
```

29. **Security audit** — IDOR fixed in `db.py` (`user_id` + ownership join on both project-scoped db helpers); Notion rate limiting (20/60s); project creation rate limiting (10/10min) + name length validation (1-200 chars); RLS tightened to SELECT-only on syntheses, transcripts, projects, notion_connections via two migration files — both applied in production. Committed `8af06a4`, `dd380aa`.
30. **Copy rewrite on page.tsx** — all user-visible strings rewritten: cut generic SaaS phrasing, headlines describe actual behavior, specifics added throughout. Committed `85a1669`.
31. **Project-first flow enforced + workspace redesigned** — synthesis now always requires a project; `?upload=1` without project falls through to hub; workspace hub redesigned (2-col, removed New synthesis card, how-it-works updated to project → synthesis → save flow); landing Create account CTA hidden for signed-in users; secondary hero button changed to "Go to projects"; freestanding New synthesis button removed from projects page header. Committed `145b37d`.
32. **Tab-open synthesis messaging** — clarified that user can switch tabs, just not close this one. Lead with permission, pair with constraint. Committed `a175406`.
33. **PROMPT.md updated and committed to repo** — removed from `.gitignore`, updated to reflect all changes from sessions 28-32.
34. **Projects page synthesis list + project-name bug** — projects page now fetches and displays synthesis runs per project (date-labeled, linked to `/syntheses/{id}`), with a one-liner pointing to Private saves. Backend: removed auto-create fallback (`"Synthesis {filename}"` project names) — `/synthesize` now returns 400 if no `project_id` when DB is available.
35. **Full OWASP security audit + 10 fixes** — ran `/vibe-app-security-audit`. Findings across all 5 audit steps. Fixed in commit `f2dd946`: exception internals hidden from clients (logged server-side), NOTION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY documented in .env.example with gen command, FastAPI docs disabled in prod, HSTS added to backend, CORS allow_headers tightened + DELETE added, auth callback `next` param validated to relative paths, PBKDF2 raised to 600K iterations (NIST 2023), Notion OAuth cancel redirects to frontend UI, N+1 projects/syntheses fetch replaced with single `GET /projects?include_syntheses=true`, job pruning on every poll, reflected URL `message` param removed from login page. Remaining: pin requirements.txt, add CI/CD + CVE scanning, nonce-based CSP, test suite.
36. **PROMPT.md updated** post-security-audit (`80a9341`).
37. **Full design audit** — ran `/ui-design-prompts` → option 1 (AUDIT). 6 fixes in commit `f45dd82`: removed border+shadow double from `.card` and navbar (border only now); unified all `zinc-*` → `neutral-*` across 11 files; standardized synthesis detail header to `mb-8`; replaced blue "Extracting" badge with brand teal (eliminates 5th accent); added `translateY(4px→0)` to `fadeIn` keyframe; fixed `<p>` as flex container in Notion push banner.
38. **Remove all subsection borders** — stripped all card/panel/section borders from every page. `.card` border removed in `globals.css` (cascades site-wide); section dividers (`border-t`), info panels, file list items, and all colored alert borders (red/green/amber) removed per-file. Dashed drag-and-drop zones and form input/button borders preserved. Committed `2185efd`.

## 12. Open / next steps

- **(A) Security/trust hardening — remaining items**
  - **Generate `NOTION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, set in Railway, reconnect Notion** — until this is done, Notion OAuth tokens sit in plaintext in Supabase
  - **Pin `requirements.txt` versions** — use `pip freeze` or `uv lock`; prevents silent CVE regressions on every Railway deploy
  - **Add GitHub Actions CI** — lint, `pip-audit`, `npm audit --audit-level=high`, build check; skeleton is in the audit report
  - **Add security test suite** — auth/401 checks, job ownership isolation, file-type validation; skeleton is in the audit report
  - **Nonce-based CSP** — remove `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` via Next.js middleware nonce injection
  - Add `/security` or `/privacy` page with honest data-flow disclosure
  - Add visible beta warning near upload for confidential/regulated data
  - Add delete controls for projects, syntheses, encrypted artifacts, and Notion connection
  - Add event logging for synthesis/private-save/notion/copy actions
  - Consider Postgres-backed job store for restart durability
- **(B) Custom domain** — buy `gist.tld`, point at Vercel via DNS.
- **(C) Phase 4 real users** — recruit first 5-10 users manually with redacted/synthetic transcripts. Lead with "private-by-default synthesis with traceable quotes."
- **(D) Watch for real-user feedback, iterate**
- **(E) Backlog**
  - Notion `default_database_id` column exists in schema but never used
  - Synthesis save errors silently swallowed — wire to Sentry / structured log
  - Notion OAuth path needs continued production testing

## 13. Useful commands

```bash
# Type-check frontend
cd gist/frontend && npx tsc --noEmit

# Verify backend imports
cd gist/backend && python -c "import main; print(sorted([r.path for r in main.app.routes if hasattr(r,'path')]))"

# Verify CORS preflight
curl -s -I -X OPTIONS https://gist-backend-production-ab73.up.railway.app/projects \
  -H "Origin: https://gist-customer-interview-synthesis.vercel.app" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"

# Refresh Supabase schema cache (in SQL Editor)
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';

# Force-prune local git orphans (after history rewrite)
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```
